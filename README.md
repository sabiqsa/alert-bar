# alert-bar
In some cases, websites require an alert box at the top of the page if there is something urgent website visitors must know. If there is an outage in a company's services, a natural disaster, or a very important message, perhaps regarding website maintenance, an alert box is the way to go. In this article, [Solodev](https://www.solodev.com/) provides you with a tutorial on adding an alert box to your website.
